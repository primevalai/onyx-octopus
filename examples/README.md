## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Examples

When creating new examples, follow this structure:

1. **File Naming**: Use sequential numbering: `09_feature_name.py`
2. **Header Documentation**: Include comprehensive docstring explaining concepts
3. **UV Commands**: All execution must use `uv run python`
4. **Performance Metrics**: Include expected execution times/throughput
5. **Error Handling**: Demonstrate proper error scenarios
6. **Documentation**: Update this README with atomic instructions

### Code Quality Standards

All examples must pass these quality checks:

```bash
# Format code
uv run black ../examples/

# Lint check  
uv run ruff check ../examples/ --fix

# Type checking (if enabled)
uv run mypy ../examples/
```

### Testing Examples

Before committing new examples, verify they work:

```bash
# Build bindings
uv run maturin develop

# Test specific example
uv run python ../examples/your_new_example.py

# Verify performance expectations
# Ensure clean execution without warnings
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Rebuild bindings if import errors occur
cd eventuali-python
uv run maturin develop
```

**Performance Issues**
```bash
# Ensure release build for performance testing
cargo build --release
uv run maturin develop --release
```

**UV Command Not Found**
```bash
# Install UV if not available
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Example Execution Failures**
```bash
# Verify working directory
cd eventuali-python  # Must be in this directory
uv run python ../examples/example_name.py
```

### Getting Help

- Check the main [README](../README.md) for setup instructions
- Review [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for development standards
