   ```bash
   # Install UV if not already installed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Build the Python Bindings**: 
   ```bash
   uv run maturin develop --release
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

## Running Examples

All examples are designed to be run with UV:

```bash
# Run all examples
uv run python examples/45_wal_optimization.py
uv run python examples/47_read_replicas.py  
uv run python examples/48_caching_layers.py
uv run python examples/49_advanced_compression.py
```

## Key Performance Concepts

### WAL Optimization
- **Synchronous Modes**: OFF (fastest) → NORMAL (balanced) → FULL (safest)
- **Checkpoint Intervals**: Balance between performance and WAL file growth
- **Cache Sizing**: More cache = better performance (up to available memory)

### Read Replicas  
- **Read Preferences**: Primary (consistent) → Secondary (scalable) → Nearest (low-latency)
- **Lag Tolerance**: Balance between consistency and availability
- **Geographic Distribution**: Reduce latency for global applications

### Caching Layers
- **Eviction Policies**: LRU (temporal) → LFU (frequency) → FIFO (simple)
- **Cache Hierarchy**: L1 (fast, small) → L2 (balanced) → L3 (large, slower)
- **TTL Strategy**: Based on data change frequency and consistency requirements

### Compression
- **Algorithm Selection**: LZ4 (speed) → ZSTD (balanced) → GZIP (ratio)  
- **Level Tuning**: 1 (fast) → 6 (balanced) → 9 (maximum compression)
- **Batch Processing**: Compress related events together for better ratios

## Real-World Applications

These optimization techniques are particularly valuable for:

- **High-Frequency Trading**: WAL optimization + caching for ultra-low latency
- **IoT Data Processing**: Compression + batch processing for massive scale
- **Global Applications**: Read replicas + geographic caching distribution
- **Analytics Platforms**: Read replicas + optimized compression for data lakes
- **Financial Services**: WAL safety-first + multi-level caching for compliance

## Monitoring and Observability

Each example includes comprehensive monitoring examples:

- **Performance Metrics**: Throughput, latency, resource utilization
- **Cache Statistics**: Hit rates, eviction rates, memory usage  
- **Replica Health**: Lag monitoring, failover detection
- **Compression Ratios**: Space savings vs CPU overhead analysis

## Best Practices

1. **Measure First**: Always benchmark with your actual data patterns
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with default configurations and optimize incrementally
3. **Monitor Continuously**: Set up alerts for key performance metrics
4. **Test Failures**: Verify failover scenarios and recovery procedures
5. **Document Decisions**: Record why specific configurations were chosen
