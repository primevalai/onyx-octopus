## Description
Fixed GitHub Actions OpenSSL build failure for manylinux wheels

## Current State
- Working Directory: /home/user01/syncs/github/primevalai/onyx-octopus
- Git Branch: master
- Modified Files: .github/workflows/build-manylinux.yml

## Active Work
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed OpenSSL build failure in GitHub Actions manylinux workflow
- **Issue**: OpenSSL development packages were being installed on host system instead of inside manylinux Docker container
- **Solution**: Used `before-script-linux` in maturin-action to install packages inside container
- **Fix Applied**: Modified `.github/workflows/build-manylinux.yml` to install openssl-devel/libssl-dev inside container

## Context
**Problem**: GitHub Actions build was failing with:
```
Could not find openssl via pkg-config:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS=1 pkg-config --libs --cflags openssl
The system library `openssl` required by crate `openssl-sys` was not found.
```

**Root Cause**: The manylinux build runs inside a Docker container, but OpenSSL packages were being installed on the Ubuntu host system where they're not accessible to the containerized build process.

**Solution Details**:
- Removed host-level package installation step
- Added `before-script-linux` to maturin-action configuration
- Script handles both yum-based and apt-based manylinux containers
- Installs openssl-devel, pkgconfig, and protobuf-devel inside container
- Maintains existing environment variables (OPENSSL_STATIC=1, OPENSSL_VENDORED=1)

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/build-manylinux.yml`: Updated maturin-action configuration

## Next Steps
1. **Commit the fix**: Commit the workflow changes to fix the CI build
2. **Test the build**: Push to GitHub and verify the manylinux build succeeds
3. **Monitor CI**: Ensure all matrix builds (x86_64, aarch64) complete successfully
4. **Verify artifacts**: Check that wheel artifacts are properly generated and uploaded

## Resume Instructions
To continue this work, use: `/continuation/load`

The fix is complete and ready to be committed. The GitHub Actions workflow should now successfully build manylinux wheels without OpenSSL errors.
